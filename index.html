        <h1> MY HOBBIES</h1>
        <h2>Books are our real friends. They are our guides. We can learn everything from them. The books contain all the great thoughts of our world and we can learn them by reading the books. The books help us find answers to our questions. The books never fail us.We should read as many books as we can. But all books are not good. So we should choose only good books and read them. Our teachers and parents can help us choose good books.</h2>
